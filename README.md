# 🗃️ **ResourcePackCached**

Optimizes the handling of server resource packs. It caches the resource pack locally, improving load times and reducing network usage for players joining servers with custom resource packs.

## 🎯 **Primary Use Case**

Ideal for modpack creators and server owners who want to:
- Keep resource packs on the server for easier updates
- Reduce modpack size by excluding resource packs
- Improve player experience with faster load times and reduced downloads

## 💻 **Functionality**

ResourcePackCached operates seamlessly in the background:

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Caches server resource packs locally on first join. |
| 2️⃣ | Automatically uses cached versions on subsequent joins. |
| 3️⃣ | Keeps resource packs loaded after disconnecting from servers. |
| 4️⃣ | Reapplies cached packs when the game starts. |

# 🗃️ **ResourcePackCached**

Optimizes server resource pack handling by caching, reusing across sessions, and eliminating redundant loading and unloading.

## 🎯 **Primary Use Case**

Ideal for those who want to:
- Keep resource packs on the server for easier updates.
- Reduce modpack size by excluding resource packs and keeping it on server.
- Improve user experience with faster load times and reduced loading and unloading.
- Reduce network usage by reusing cached resource packs.
- Do debugging for mods/plugins using resource packs (faster load times).

## 💻 **Functionality**

ResourcePackCached operates seamlessly in the background:

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1️⃣ | Downloads and caches server resource packs on first join. |
| 2️⃣ | Skips loading of resource packs on subsequent joins. |
| 3️⃣ | Keeps resource packs loaded after disconnecting from servers. |
| 4️⃣ | Reapplies cached packs when the game starts. |
